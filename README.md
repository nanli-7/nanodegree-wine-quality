# Explore Red Wine Quality 

In this project, we use R and apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

This project was completed and documented in an R Markdown formatted file - [wine_quality_analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/nanli-7/nanodegree-wine-quality/blob/master/wine_quality_analysis.Rmd).
